## 1.9 RESEARCH ON OPERATING SYSTEMS

<p  align = "justify">Computer science is a rapidly advancing field and it is hard to predict where it is going. Researchers at universities and industrial research labs are constantly thinking up new ideas, some of which go nowhere but some of which become the cornerstone of future products and have massive impact on the industry and users. Telling which is which turns out to be easier to do in hindsight than in real time. Separating the wheat from the chaff is especially difficult because it often takes 20 to 30 years from idea to impact.</p>

<p  align = "justify">For example, when President Eisenhower set up the Dept. of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958, he was trying to keep the Army from killing the Navy and the Air Force over the Pentagon’s research budget. He was not trying to invent the Internet. But one of the things ARPA did was fund some university research on the then-obscure concept of packet switching, which led to the first experimental packet-switched network, the ARPANET. It went live in 1969. Before long, other ARPA-funded research networks were connected to the ARPANET, and the Internet was born. The Internet was then happil used by academic researchers for sending email to each other for 20 years. In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at the CERN research lab in Geneva and Marc Andreesen wrote a graphical browser for it at the University of Illinois. All of a sudden the Internet was full of twittering teenagers. President Eisenhower is probably rolling over in his grave.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Research in operating systems has also led to dramatic changes in practical systems. As we discussed earlier, the first commercial computer systems were all batch systems, until M.I.T. inv ented general-purpose timesharing in the early 1960s. Computers were all text-based until Doug Engelbart invented the mouse and the graphical user interface at Stanford Research Institute in the late 1960s. Who knows what will come next?</p>

<p  align = "justify">In this section and in comparable sections throughout the book, we will take a brief look at some of the research in operating systems that has taken place during</p> 

---

<p  align = "justify">the past 5 to 10 years, just to give a flavor of what might be on the horizon. This introduction is certainly not comprehensive. It is based largely on papers that have been published in the top research conferences because these ideas have at least survived a rigorous peer review process in order to get published. Note that in computer science—in contrast to other scientific fields—most research is published in conferences, not in journals. Most of the papers cited in the research sections wer published by either ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, or USENIX and are available over the Internet to (student) members of these organizations.

<p  align = "justify">Virtually all operating systems researchers realize that current operating systems are massive, inflexible, unreliable, insecure, and loaded with bugs, certain ones more than others <i>(names withheld here to protect the guilty).</i> Consequently, there is a lot of research on how to build better operating systems. Work has recently been published about bugs and debugging (Renzelmann et al., 2012; and Zhou et al., 2012), crash recovery (Correia et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Ongaro et al., 2011; and Yeh and Cheng, 2012), energy management (Pathak et al., 2012; Petrucci and Loques, 2012; and Shen et al., 2013), file and storage systems (Elnably and Wang, 2012; Nightingale et al., 2012; and Zhang et al., 2013a), high-performance I/O (De Bruijn et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013a; and Rizzo, 2012), hyperthreading and multithreading (Liu et al., 2011), live update (Giuffrida et al., 2013), managing GPUs (Rossbach et al., 2011), memory management (Jantz et al., 2013; and Jeong et al., 2013), multicore operating systems (Baumann et al., 2009; Kapritsos, 2012; Lachaize et al., 2012; and Wentzlaff et al., 2012), operating system correctness (Elphinstone et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006; and Klein et al., 2009), operating system reliability (Hruby et al., 2012; Ryzhyk et al., 2009, 2011 and Zheng et al., 2012), privacy and security (Dunn et al., 2012; Giuffrida et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013b; Lorch et al., 2013; Ortolani and Crispo, 2012; Slowinska et al., 2012; and Ur et al., 2012), usage and performance monitoring (Harter et. al, 2012; and Ravindranath et al., 2012), and virtualization (Agesen et al., 2012; Ben-Yehuda et al. 2010; Colp et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2013; Tarasov et al., 2013; and Williams et al., 2012) among many other topics.</p>

## 1.10 OUTLINE OF THE REST OF THIS BOOK

<p  align = "justify">We hav e now completed our introduction and bird’s-eye view of the operating system. It is time to get down to the details. As mentioned already, from the programmer’s point of view, the primary purpose of an operating system is to provide</p> 

---

<p  align = "justify">some key abstractions, the most important of which are processes and threads, address spaces, and files. Accordingly the next three chapters are devoted to these critical topics.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Chapter 2 is about processes and threads. It discusses their properties and how they communicate with one another. It also gives a number of detailed examples of how interprocess communication works and how to avoid some of the pitfalls.</p>

<p  align = "justify">In Chap. 3 we will study address spaces and their adjunct, memory management, in detail. The important topic of virtual memory will be examined, along with closely related concepts such as paging and segmentation.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Then, in Chap. 4, we come to the all-important topic of file systems. To a considerable extent, what the user sees is largely the file system. We will look at both the file-system interface and the file-system implementation.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Input/Output is covered in Chap. 5. The concepts of device independence an device dependence will be looked at. Several important devices, including disks, keyboards, and displays, will be used as examples.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Chapter 6 is about deadlocks. We briefly showed what deadlocks are in this chapter, but there is much more to say. Ways to prevent or avoid them are discussed.</p>

<p  align = "justify">At this point we will have completed our study of the basic principles of single-CPU operating systems. However, there is more to say, especially about advanced topics. In Chap. 7, we examine virtualization. We discuss both the principles, and some of the existing virtualization solutions in detail. Since virtualization is heavily used in cloud computing, we will also gaze at existing clouds. Another advanced topic is multiprocessor systems, including multicores, parallel computers, and distributed systems. These subjects are covered in Chap. 8.</p>

<p  align = "justify">A hugely important subject is operating system security, which is covered in Chap 9. Among the topics discussed in this chapter are threats (e.g., viruses and worms), protection mechanisms, and security models.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Next we have some case studies of real operating systems. These are UNIX, Linux, and Android (Chap. 10), and Windows 8 (Chap. 11). The text concludes with some wisdom and thoughts about operating system design in Chap. 12.</p>

## 1.11 METRIC UNITS

<p  align = "justify">To avoid any confusion, it is worth stating explicitly that in this book, as in computer science in general, metric units are used instead of traditional English units (the furlong-stone-fortnight system). The principal metric prefixes are listed in Fig. 1-31. The prefixes are typically abbreviated by their first letters, with the units greater than 1 capitalized. Thus a 1-TB database occupies 1012 bytes of storage and a 100-psec (or 100-ps) clock ticks every 10−10 seconds. Since milli and micro both begin with the letter ‘‘m,’’ a choice had to be made. Normally, ‘‘m’’ is for milli and ‘‘μ’’ (the Greek letter mu) is for micro</p>

---

<p  align = "center"><img src = "figure 1.30.png"><br>Figure 1-31. The principal metric prefixes.</p>

<p  align = "justify">It is also worth pointing out that, in common industry practice, the units for measuring memory sizes have slightly different meanings. There kilo means 210 (1024) rather than 103 (1000) because memories are always a power of two. Thus a 1-KB memory contains 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes. Similarly, a 1-MB memory contains 220 (1,048,576) bytes and a 1-GB memory contains 230 (1,073,741,824) bytes. However, a 1-Kbps communication line transmits 1000 bits per second and a 10-Mbps LAN runs at 10,000,000 bits/sec because these speeds are not powers of two. Unfortunately, many people tend to mix up these two systems, especially for disk sizes. To avoid ambiguity, in this book, we will use the symbols KB, MB, and GB for 210, 220, and 230 bytes respectively, and the symbols Kbps, Mbps, and Gbps for 103, 106, and 109 bits/sec, respectively.</p>

## 1.12 SUMMARY

<p  align = "justify">Operating systems can be viewed from two viewpoints: resource managers and extended machines. In the resource-manager view, the operating system’s job is to manage the different parts of the system efficiently. In the extended-machine view, the job of the system is to provide the users with abstractions that are more convenient to use than the actual machine. These include processes, address spaces, and files.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Operating systems have a long history, starting from the days when they replaced the operator, to modern multiprogramming systems. Highlights include early batch systems, multiprogramming systems, and personal computer systems.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Since operating systems interact closely with the hardware, some knowledge of computer hardware is useful to understanding them. Computers are built up of processors, memories, and I/O devices. These parts are connected by buses.</p>

<p  align = "justify">The basic concepts on which all operating systems are built are processes, memory management, I/O management, the file system, and security. Each of these will be treated in a subsequent chapter.</p>

---

<p  align = "justify">The heart of any operating system is the set of system calls that it can handle. These tell what the operating system really does. For UNIX, we have looked at four groups of system calls. The first group of system calls relates to process creation and termination. The second group is for reading and writing files. The third group is for directory management. The fourth group contains miscellaneous calls.</p>

<p  align = "justify">Operating systems can be structured in several ways. The most common ones are as a monolithic system, a hierarchy of layers, microkernel, client-server, virtual machine, or exokernel.</p>

PROBLEMS
1. What are the two main functions of an operating system?

2. In Section 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of
applications for each of these systems (one per operating systems type).

3. What is the difference between timesharing and multiprogramming systems?

4. To use cache memory, main memory is divided into cache lines, typically 32 or 64 bytes long. An entire cache line is cached at once. What is the advantage of caching an entire line instead of a single byte or word at a time?

5. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA). What implications does this have for multiprogramming?

6. Instructions related to accessing I/O devices are typically privileged instructions, that is, they can be executed in kernel mode but not in user mode. Give a reason why these instructions are privileged.


7. The family-of-computers idea was introduced in the 1960s with the IBM System/360 mainframes. Is this idea now dead as a doornail or does it live on?

8. One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was the cost of the hardware needed to support them. How much video RAM is needed to support a 25-line × 80-row character monochrome text screen? How much for a 1200 × 900-pixel 24-bit color bitmap? What was the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)? How much is it now?

9. There are several design goals in building an operating system, for example, resource utilization, timeliness, robustness, and so on. Give an example of two design goals that may contradict one another.

10. What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain how having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system.

11. A 255-GB disk has 65,536 cylinders with 255 sectors per track and 512 bytes per sector. How many platters and heads does this disk have? Assuming an average cylinder seek time of 11 ms, average rotational delay of 7 msec and reading rate of 100 MB/sec, calculate the average time it will take to read 400 KB from one sector.

12. Which of the following instructions should be allowed only in kernel mode?
(a) Disable all interrupts.
(b) Read the time-of-day clock.
(c) Set the time-of-day clock.
(d) Change the memory map.

13. Consider a system that has two CPUs, each CPU having two threads (hyperthreading). Suppose three programs, P0, P1, and P2, are started with run times of 5, 10 and 20 msec, respectively. How long will it take to complete the execution of these programs? Assume that all three programs are 100% CPU bound, do not block during execution, and do not change CPUs once assigned.

14. A computer has a pipeline with four stages. Each stage takes the same time to do its work, namely, 1 nsec. How many instructions per second can this machine execute?

15. Consider a computer system that has cache memory, main memory (RAM) and disk and an operating system that uses virtual memory. It takes 1 nsec to access a word from the cache, 10 nsec to access a word from the RAM, and 10 ms to access a word from the disk. If the cache hit rate is 95% and main memory hit rate (after a cache miss) is 99%, what is the average time to access a word?

16. When a user program makes a system call to read or write a disk file, it provides an indication of which file it wants, a pointer to the data buffer, and the count. Control is then transferred to the operating system, which calls the appropriate driver. Suppose that the driver starts the disk and terminates until an interrupt occurs. In the case of reading from the disk, obviously the caller will have to be blocked (because there are no data for it). What about the case of writing to the disk? Need the caller be blocked aw aiting completion of the disk transfer?

17. What is a trap instruction? Explain its use in operating systems.

18. Why is the process table needed in a timesharing system? Is it also needed in personal computer systems running UNIX or Windows with a single user?

19. Is there any reason why you might want to mount a file system on a nonempty directory? If so, what is it?

20. For each of the following system calls, give a condition that causes it to fail: fork, exec, and unlink.

21. What type of multiplexing (time, space, or both) can be used for sharing the following resources: CPU, memory, disk, network card, printer, keyboard, and display?

22. Can th 
count = write(fd, buffer, nbytes);
call return any value in count other than nbytes? If so, why?

23. A file whose file descriptor is fd contains the following sequence of bytes: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5. The following system calls are made: lseek(fd, 3, SEEK SET); read(fd, &buffer, 4);CHAP. 1 PROBLEMS 83 where the lseek call makes a seek to byte 3 of the file. What does buffer contain after the read has completed?

24. Suppose that a 10-MB file is stored on a disk on the same track (track 50) in consecutive sectors. The disk arm is currently situated over track number 100. How long will it take to retrieve this file from the disk? Assume that it takes about 1 ms to move the arm from one cylinder to the next and about 5 ms for the sector where the beginning of the file is stored to rotate under the head. Also, assume that reading occurs at a rate of 200 MB/s.

25. What is the essential difference between a block special file and a character special file?

26. In the example given in Fig. 1-17, the library procedure is called read and the system call itself is called read. Is it essential that both of these have the same name? If not, which one is more important?

27. Modern operating systems decouple a process address space from the machine’s physical memory. List two advantages of this design.

28. To a programmer, a system call looks like any other call to a library procedure. Is it important that a programmer know which library procedures result in system calls? Under what circumstances and why?

29. Figure 1-23 shows that a number of UNIX system calls have no Win32 API equivalents. For each of the calls listed as having no Win32 equivalent, what are the consequences for a programmer of converting a UNIX program to run under Windows?

30. A portable operating system is one that can be ported from one system architecture to another without any modification. Explain why it is infeasible to build an operating system that is completely portable. Describe two high-level layers that you will have in designing an operating system that is highly portable.

31. Explain how separation of policy and mechanism aids in building microkernel-based operating systems.

32. Virtual machines have become very popular for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, they hav e some downsides. Name one.
33. Here are some questions for practicing unit conversions:
(a) How long is a nanoyear in seconds?
(b) Micrometers are often called microns. How long is a megamicron?
(c) How many bytes are there in a 1-PB memory?
(d) The mass of the earth is 6000 yottagrams. What is that in kilograms?

34. Write a shell that is similar to Fig. 1-19 but contains enough code that it actually works so you can test it. You might also add some features such as redirection of input and output, pipes, and background jobs.

35. If you have a personal UNIX-like system (Linux, MINIX 3, FreeBSD, etc.) available that you can safely crash and reboot, write a shell script that attempts to create an unlimited number of child processes and observe what happens. Before running the experiment, type sync to the shell to flush the file system buffers to disk to avoid ruining the file system. You can also do the experiment safely in a virtual machine.
Note: Do not try this on a shared system without first getting permission from the system administrator. The consequences will be instantly obvious so you are likely to be caught and sanctions may follow.

36. Examine and try to interpret the contents of a UNIX-like or Windows directory with a tool like the UNIX od program. (Hint: How you do this will depend upon what the OS allows. One trick that may work is to create a directory on a USB stick with one operating system and then read the raw device data using a different operating system that allows such access.)
